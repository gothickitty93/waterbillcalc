This is a simple python script to help calucate your water bill. Created with the help of OpenAI's ChatGPT-4.

The CLI version was intially made by OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, and modified by me.
The GUI version used my modified CLI code as a base, but all changes to "GUI-ify" are entirely made by OpenAI's ChatGPT-4.
